              <p class="big">"Massage therapy involves hands-on techniques to increase circulation, relieve tension, reduce stress, relieve anxiety, improve sleep, and promote relaxation throughout the entire body, which all lead to additional benefits.</p>
              <p class="big text-gray bold">Whether chronic or acute, if someone is tense and in need of a release, or they have been injured and have extensive muscle and/or nerve tissue damage that plagues their body, massage therapy might be worth exploring. It can also be a preventative measure for future problems."</p>

              <p class="big">“Myofascial Release is a safe and very effective hands-on technique that involves applying gentle sustained pressure into the Myofascial connective tissue restrictions to eliminate pain and restore motion. Trauma, inflammatory responses, and/or surgical procedures create Myofascial restrictions that can produce tensile pressures of approximately 2,000 pounds per square inch on pain sensitive structures that do not show up in many of the standard tests (x-rays, myelograms, CAT scans, electromyography, etc.).<br />The use of Myofascial Release allows us to look at each patient as a unique individual. Our one-on-one therapy sessions are hands-on treatments during which our therapists use a multitude of Myofascial Release techniques and movement therapy. Each Myofascial Release Treatment session is performed directly on skin without oils, creams or machinery. This enables the therapist to accurately detect fascial restrictions and apply the appropriate amount of sustained pressure to facilitate release of the fascia."</p>

            <h4 class="text-center" style="font-size:23px;">Swedish</h4>
              <p class="big">Swedish Massage is one of the most common forms of massage therapy. It revolves around long gliding strokes, using lotion to increase the circulation of blood and lymph throughout the system. There are many great benefits that come with a Swedish massage, such as increased range of motion, relaxation, circulation, endorphin release to improve mood, detoxification and many more!</p>

            	 <h4 class="text-center" style="font-size:23px;">Deep Tissue</h4>
              <p class="big">Deep Tissue Massage involves applying pressure to the client’s area of discomfort and surrounding areas to release tension. Applying consistent pressure allows the therapist to concentrate on the deep layers of muscle and fascia. This type of massage is most helpful for athletes and others who have chronic tension from continued use.</p>
            	 <h4 class="text-center" style="font-size:23px;">Trigger Point</h4>
              <p class="big">Trigger Point massage is used to alleviate tight areas in muscle tissue or knots that have formed due to overuse. The therapist will use their fingers, hands, elbows or a tool to press firmly down on the trigger point until the tissue starts to slowly release. This therapy is usually involved in other forms of massage but can also be done on its own.</p>
