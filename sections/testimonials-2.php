                      <q>Jen Marowski is a Godsend; a true delight to work with. Her practice in holistic medicine is none like I have ever seen nor experienced before. When I was recommended to her, my digestive issues were at the height of pain, as this had been a struggle for a while -- I have been going to her for a little over a year now, and my digestive system has improved exponentially through her practice! Even in the entire process, Jen has been so personal with me and a huge encouragement in this healing journey. She is truly gifted with knowledge in holistic medicine, a wisdom to know how to use it, and a big heart for each and every one of her patients. I have recommended her to others, and I will continue to! Everyone needs to know about it!</q>

<q>My 14 year old daughter has always had minor allergies. Recently her symptoms have started to get worse.  Everyday she would wake up congested and had dark circles under her eyes.  I took her to an ENT who said her sinuses were blocked. He prescribed a nasal spray.  The nasal spray helped, but it became part of her daily routine.  When I heard about Advanced Allergy I decided to give it a try. She noticed an immediate improvement.  After a few visits all her symptoms were gone. She loved having the treatments done and said it was like a mini massage on her spine. I like the fact that it is all natural and she doesn't have to rely on medication. Now she wakes up refreshed and feeling great!</q>

                      <q>I had been suffering from seasonal allergy symptoms since I was a teenager. For many, many years I tried all the conventional testing and treatments.  I had taken most of the prescription pills and sprays. I had sampled homeopathic remedies.  As each new round of treatments failed to ease the sneezing, runny nose and itchy eyes that made it difficult to go outside on many days each Spring and Fall, I would go back to over the counter medications. These, too, rarely brought any relief. Over the last several months, working with Jen at [Jankovic Chiropractic], I experienced a breakthrough. By applying Advanced Allergy Therapeutics, the folks at [Jankovic Chiropractic] were able to methodically clear me of my most severe allergies and I experienced the best Autumn in memory â€“ free of the allergy symptoms that had been my companion for much of my life.  It has been a game-changing experience for me to be able to head outdoors without hesitation to enjoy golfing, rolling around on the grass with my kids, or even cutting the lawn.</q>

                      <q>My daughter has suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms for the last ten years that were unable to be diagnosed or remedied by numerous doctors and specialists. Her condition was so bad that she was unable to attend school or participate in social activities. When we started seeing Jen and taking the AAT approach, it was the first time that we really felt heard, that someone understood what was going on with her body, and for the first time in years, she had relief from her symptoms. Jen has such a caring manner and has a wonderful way of listening to my daughter's body and understanding what it needs. Now for the first time in years, my daughter's symptoms are gone thanks to Jen's recommendations and AAT treatment. We are so grateful to have found some answers!</q>
