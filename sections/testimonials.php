                      <q>My daughter has suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms for the last ten years that were unable to be diagnosed or remedied by numerous doctors and specialists. Her condition was so bad that she was unable to attend school or participate in social activities. When we started seeing Jen and taking the AAT approach, it was the first time that we really felt heard, that someone understood what was going on with her body, and for the first time in years, she had relief from her symptoms. Jen has such a caring manner and has a wonderful way of listening to my daughter's body and understanding what it needs. Now for the first time in years, my daughter's symptoms are gone thanks to Jen's recommendations and AAT treatment. We are so grateful to have found some answers!</q>

                      <q>Jen Marowski is a Godsend; a true delight to work with. Her practice in holistic medicine is none like I have ever seen nor experienced before. When I was recommended to her, my digestive issues were at the height of pain, as this had been a struggle for a while -- I have been going to her for a little over a year now, and my digestive system has improved exponentially through her practice! Even in the entire process, Jen has been so personal with me and a huge encouragement in this healing journey. She is truly gifted with knowledge in holistic medicine, a wisdom to know how to use it, and a big heart for each and every one of her patients. I have recommended her to others, and I will continue to! Everyone needs to know about it!</q>
